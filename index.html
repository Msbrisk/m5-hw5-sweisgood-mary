                 <p>
                    I am a native of Florida and currently reside in St. Augustine, Florida with my husband and two mini-dachsunds, Lily and Louie.
                    We have two children. Our son is 24 and our daughter is 19. I work for a wine and spirits distributor and am pursuing my masters degree at the University of Florida.
                    I enjoy going to concerts and plays, going to the beach and watching college football.
                 </p>

                    I love to travel and have been fortunate to travel for work to visit wineries overseas in Italy, Spain, Portugal, Argentina, and Australia,
                    and domestically to California, Oregon, amd Washington. Our family has traveled extensively in the United States and to England, Ireland, and Italy.
                    Our family plans to conitinue to continue to travel as much as possible and broaden our perspectives.
